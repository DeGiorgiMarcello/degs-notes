# Welcome to my personal notes

Multiple times I've managed to solve a new problem using an old solution, pleased to notice how much time I saved and how the quality of the final result has increased since the first time I had struggled with the original problem.

I know, it's simply the definition of the [learning curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve), but I've always been fascinated by how good the brain is in learning and storing new stuff!

In my daily work I often tend to go back and take a look at some old code that I or my colleges have written. Unfortunately this is not always possible, especially if your code is in your company's protected repositories and you are just sitting confortably on the couch, with your personal laptop on the lap, and the *work laptop* is in your *work bag* in the other room, or (much more reasonably) if you just changed job. 

For this reason I've decide to collect here some guides, tutorials and personal notes that could be useful in the future. 

Enjoy your reading!
