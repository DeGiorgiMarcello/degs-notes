My name is Marcello and in the last few years I have been working as Data Engineer developing ETL pipelines and tools to simplify and standardize the whole data cleansing process. I'm a sci-fi books enthusiast, cook and language learner. I strongly believe in knowledge sharing and teaching as a tool for a better learning.
